## Documentation

üåé **Anatomy of a HTML**

```html
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

An element in HTML has three parts:

1. **Opening tag:** It marks the beginning of the element and is enclosed in angle brackets. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph.

2. **Content:** This is the actual text or information within the element. For a paragraph element, it's the text of the paragraph.

3. **Closing tag:** Similar to the opening tag but with a forward slash before the element name. It marks the end of the element. For a paragraph, the closing tag is `</p>`.

So, an HTML element is a combination of the opening tag, content, and closing tag.

üåé **NESTING ELEMENTS**

In HTML, elements can be nested, meaning one element can be placed inside another. For example, if we want to emphasize that our cat is very grumpy, we can use the `<strong>` element to make the word "very" bold within the paragraph:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

üåé **VOID ELEMENTS**

It's important that the opening and closing tags are properly nested, meaning they are inside each other without overlapping.

Some HTML elements don't follow the usual pattern of an opening tag, content, and closing tag. They are called "void elements." An example is the `<img>` element, which is used to embed an image. It consists of a single tag and is used like this:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Firefox icon" />
```

In this example, the `<img>` element embeds an image onto the page, and it doesn't have a closing tag.

üåé **ATTRIBUTES**

In HTML, attributes provide extra information about an element. Here's how to use them with the `<img>` element:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="The Firefox icon" width="300" height="300" />
```

Attributes are added to the element tag and include information such as the image source (`src`), alternative text (`alt`), width (`width`), and height (`height`). Each attribute is separated by spaces and follows the pattern: `attribute="value"`.


üåé **BOOLEAN ATTRIBUTES**

In HTML, some attributes are written without values and are called Boolean attributes. They can only have one value, usually the same as the attribute name. For example, the disabled attribute can be used with form input elements to prevent user entries. It can be written with or without a value:
```html
<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
```
As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:

```html
<!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -->

<input type="text" disabled />

<!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute -->

<input type="text" />

```

üåé **OMITTING QUOTES AROUND ATTRIBUTES VALUES**

The provided HTML code features an anchor element (<a>) creating a hyperlink. Initially, only the href attribute is used:

```html
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>
```

However, issues arise when adding a title attribute without quotes:

```html
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>
```

The absence of quotes causes the browser to misinterpret the title attribute, leading to errors. To correct this, use quotes around attribute values:

```html
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla homepage">favorite website</a>
```

This ensures proper attribute handling and avoids potential problems in the markup.

üåé **SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTES**

You can use either single or double quotes for HTML attribute values based on your preference. Both are equivalent:

```html
<a href='https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>
<a href="https://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a>
```

However, it's crucial not to mix single and double quotes, as shown in the problematic example below:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>
```

Ensure consistency by using either single or double quotes throughout your HTML code.

üßµ **Anatomy of an HTML Document**

The provided code is a basic HTML document with the following structure:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's a breakdown of each section:

- `<!doctype html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).

- `<html lang="en-US">`: The opening tag for the HTML document, indicating the language as English (United States).

- `<head>`: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as character encoding and the document's title.

- `<meta charset="utf-8" />`: Specifies the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, which is widely used for supporting various characters.

- `<title>My test page</title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document to "My test page."

- `<body>`: The main content of the HTML document goes within this section.

- `<p>This is my page</p>`: A paragraph of text inside the body, stating "This is my page."

- `</html>`: The closing tag for the HTML document.

This example represents a simple HTML document structure with a title and a paragraph of text.


üßµ **Creation of an Sample HTML Document**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is my First HTML Intro Page</h1>
    <p>You can listen to the music which is <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msokY714Wzg/">composed by me</a></strong>. It is streaming on all platforms.</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

üßµ **Entity references: Including special characters in HTML**

In HTML, certain characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `&` have special meanings in the syntax. To include them as regular text, use character references. These references start with `&` and end with `;`:

- `<` is represented as `&lt;`
- `>` is represented as `&gt;`
- `"` is represented as `&quot;`
- `'` is represented as `&apos;`
- `&` is represented as `&amp;`

The character reference equivalent could be easily remembered because the text it uses can be seen as less than for &lt;, quotation for &quot; and similarly for others.

In the example below, there are two paragraphs:
```html
<p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the <p> element.</p>

<p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
```
In the output below, you can see that the first paragraph has gone wrong. The browser interprets the second instance of <p> as starting a new paragraph. The second paragraph looks fine because it has angle brackets with character references.

```html
In HTML, you define a paragraph using the

element.

In HTML, you define a paragraph using the <p> element.
```

üßµ **HTML comments**

In HTML, comments are a way to include notes in the code for explanation or documentation purposes. Browsers ignore comments, making them invisible to users. Comments are useful for explaining logic, especially when revisiting code after some time, and they serve as valuable documentation when multiple people are working on the codebase.

To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <!-- and -->. For example:

```html
<p>I'm not inside a comment</p>

<!-- <p>I am!</p> -->

```


## What's in the head? Metadata in HTML

‚òùÔ∏è **What is HTML Head ?**

The HTML head is the contents of the <head> element. Unlike the contents of the <body> element (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document.
```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>My test page</title>
</head>
```

‚òùÔ∏è **Adding a title**

We've already seen the <title> element in action ‚Äî this can be used to add a title to the document. This however can get confused with the h1 element, which is used to add a top level heading to your body content ‚Äî this is also sometimes referred to as the page title. But they are different things!

1. **`<h1>`** Element:
   - Appears on the loaded page in the browser.
   - Should be used once per page to mark up the main title of your content, such as a story title or news headline.

2. **`<title>`** Element:
   - Represents metadata for the overall HTML document.
   - Reflects the title of the entire HTML document, not the content within the document.

Example code and screenshot:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>&lt;title&gt; element</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>&lt;h1&gt; element</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

![Logo](https://github.com/adityahongal/html/blob/main/images/diff%20between%20title%20%26%20h1.png)


‚òù **Metadata: the <meta> element**

Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document ‚Äî the ```<meta>``` element.

Specifying your document's character encoding

```html 
<meta charset="utf-8" /> 
```
In the above example,this element specifies the document's character encoding ‚Äî the character set that the document is permitted to use. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes pretty much any character from any human language. This means that your web page will be able to handle displaying any language; it's therefore a good idea to set this on every web page you create!

‚òù **Applying CSS and Javascript to HTML**

To enhance the appearance and functionality of websites, CSS and JavaScript are commonly used. In HTML, you employ the `<link>` element for CSS and the `<script>` element for JavaScript.

For CSS:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="my-css-file.css" />
```

This goes inside the `<head>` of your document.

For JavaScript:

```html
<script src="my-js-file.js" defer></script>
```

Also placed in the `<head>`, the `defer` attribute ensures that the JavaScript is loaded after the HTML is parsed, preventing potential errors.

‚òù **Setting Primary language of the Document**

Set your webpage's language by adding the "lang" attribute to the opening HTML tag, like this:

```html
<html lang="en-US">
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</html>
```

This not only helps search engines index your document more effectively but also enhances accessibility for users, especially those with visual impairments who rely on screen readers.


## HTML Text Fundamentals

One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends.

üñãÔ∏è **The basics - Headings and Paragraphs**

Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.

Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.

In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <p> element, like so:
```html
<p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>
```

Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:
```html
<h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>
```

There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; <h1> represents the main heading, <h2> represents subheadings, <h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.

üñãÔ∏è **Implementing structural hierarchy**

For example, in this story, the <h1> element represents the title of the story, the <h2> elements represent the title of each chapter, and the <h3> elements represent sub-sections of each chapter:

```html
<h1>The Crushing Bore</h1>

<p>By Chris Mills</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: The dark night</h2>

<p>
  It was a dark night. Somewhere, an owl hooted. The rain lashed down on the‚Ä¶
</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The eternal silence</h2>

<p>Our protagonist could not so much as a whisper out of the shadowy figure‚Ä¶</p>

<h3>The specter speaks</h3>

<p>
  Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt
  upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"
</p>
```

When creating structural hierarchies in HTML, consider these best practices:

1. Use a single `<h1>` per page as the top-level heading.
2. Ensure the correct order of headings in the hierarchy. Avoid using, for instance, `<h3>` elements for subheadings followed by `<h2>` elements for sub-subheadings.
3. Aim to use no more than three heading levels per page, unless absolutely necessary. Too many levels can make the document complex and challenging to navigate. In such cases, consider spreading the content across multiple pages.

These guidelines help maintain a logical and organized structure for your content.

üñãÔ∏è **Lists**

Now, let's talk about lists. Lists are ubiquitous in daily life, from your shopping list to the steps you follow to reach your home. Similarly, on the web, there are three main types of lists to consider.

**Unordered Lists**

Unordered lists are for items where the order doesn't matter. For instance, a shopping list:

Start with a `<ul>` element that wraps around all the list items:

Wrap each item in a `<li>` (list item) element:

```html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>bread</li>
  <li>hummus</li>
</ul>
```

**Ordered Lists**

Ordered lists are used when the order of items matters, like a set of directions:

Markup is similar to unordered lists, but use `<ol>` (ordered list) instead of `<ul>`:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
  <li>Turn right</li>
  <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
  <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
  <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
</ol>
```

**Nested Lists**

It is perfectly OK to nest one list inside another one. You might want to have some sub-bullets sitting below a top-level bullet.

```html
<ol>
  <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
  <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
  <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
  <li>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
      </li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
 
```

üñãÔ∏è **Emphasis & Importance**

HTML offers semantic elements to emphasize and mark up textual content, allowing you to convey importance or alter the meaning of sentences.

**Emphasis**

In HTML, the `<em>` (emphasis) element is used to mark up text when you want to add emphasis, similar to how we stress words in spoken language. This not only enhances readability but is also recognized by screen readers, which may convey the emphasized text differently. While browsers typically style `<em>` text as italic, it's important to note that this element is not meant for styling purposes alone.

Example:

```html
<p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late</em>.</p>
```

**Importance**

In HTML, the `<strong>` element is used to emphasize important words, similar to stressing them in spoken language and bolding them in written language. This not only enhances the document's usefulness but is also recognized by screen readers, allowing them to convey the emphasized text differently. Although browsers typically style `<strong>` text as bold, it's crucial to note that this element serves a semantic purpose beyond styling.

Example:

```html
<p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>

<p>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</p>
```


You can nest strong and emphasis inside one another if desired:

```html
<p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong> ‚Äî if you drink it, <strong>you may <em>die</em></strong>.</p>
```

üñãÔ∏è **Italic,Bold and Underline**

In HTML, the `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>` elements were originally introduced for styling text with bold, italics, or underline in a time when CSS support was limited. However, these are considered presentational elements, influencing appearance rather than semantics. With HTML5, they were redefined with new semantic roles, but their use is now discouraged in favor of more meaningful and accessible elements like `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<mark>`, or `<span>`.

Here's a rule of thumb: Use `<b>`, `<i>`, or `<u>` only when there's no more suitable element, and always consider alternatives for better semantics. Accessibility is crucial, and elements like `<i>` may not be helpful for screen readers or users of different writing systems.

- `<i>` conveys meaning traditionally expressed in italics, such as foreign words, taxonomic designations, technical terms, or thoughts.
- `<b>` conveys meaning traditionally expressed in bold, like keywords, product names, or lead sentences.
- `<u>` conveys meaning traditionally expressed with underline, such as proper names or misspellings.
## Creating Hyperlinks

üîó **What is a Hyperlink ?**

Hyperlinks are a fundamental feature of the Web, defining its interconnected nature. Since the inception of the Web, hyperlinks have enabled the linking of documents or resources, directing to specific sections or making applications accessible through web addresses (URLs). By converting web content into clickable links, users can seamlessly navigate between different web locations.

üîó **Anatomy of a Link**

A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

```html
<p>
  I'm creating a link to
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>
```

**Block Level Links**

Almost any content can be made into a link, even block-level elements. If you want to make a heading element a link then wrap it in an anchor (<a>) element as shown in the following code snippet:

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
  <h1>MDN Web Docs</h1>
</a>
<p>
  Documenting web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, since 2005.
</p>
```

**Image Link**

If you have an image you want to make into a link, use the <a> element to wrap the image file referenced with the <img> element. The example below uses a relative path to reference a locally stored PNG image file.

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
  <img src="mdn_logo.png" alt="MDN Web Docs" />
</a>
```

**Adding supporting information with the title attribute**

Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title. The title contains additional information about the link, such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.

```html
<p>
  I'm creating my first hyperlink to my YOUTUBE
  <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msokY714Wzg"
    title="Checkout my Music Video on Youtube"> click here for link
    </a>.
  </p>
```

This gives us the following result and hovering over the link displays the title as a tooltip:

https://github.com/adityahongal/html/blob/main/images/Creating%20first%20hyperlink.png

üîó **URLs and Paths**

A URL, short for Uniform Resource Locator, is a text string specifying the location of something on the Web. For instance, Mozilla's English homepage is at https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/.

URLs utilize paths to locate files, defining their position in the filesystem. Consider a directory structure, like the one in the "creating-hyperlinks" directory. The root, "creating-hyperlinks," encompasses an index.html file and a contacts.html file. In a live website, index.html typically serves as the home or landing page.

Inside the root, there are two directories, "pdfs" and "projects," each containing a file‚Äîproject-brief.pdf and index.html, respectively.

1. **Same directory:**
   To hyperlink from index.html to contacts.html, which is in the same directory, you directly specify the filename:
   ```html
   <p>Want to contact us? Visit our <a href="contacts.html">contacts page</a>.</p>
   ```

2. **Moving down into subdirectories:**
   To link from index.html to projects/index.html, you navigate into the "projects" directory and then specify the file:
   ```html
   <p>Explore my <a href="projects/index.html">project homepage</a>.</p>
   ```

3. **Moving back up into parent directories:**
   To link from projects/index.html to pdfs/project-brief.pdf, you go up a level and then into the "pdfs" directory:
   ```html
   <p>Access the <a href="../pdfs/project-brief.pdf">project brief</a>.</p>
   ```

This way, URLs help establish the structure and accessibility of files within a website.


**Document Fragment**

You can link to specific parts of an HTML document, known as document fragments, by assigning an `id` attribute to the desired element. Typically, linking to a heading is practical, like this:

```html
<h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>
```

To create a hyperlink to this specific id, append it to the URL preceded by a hash/pound symbol (#), as shown:

```html
<p>Write us a letter using our <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address">mailing address</a>.</p>
```

You can also use the document fragment reference on its own to link to another part of the current document:

```html
<p>The <a href="#Mailing_address">company mailing address</a> is at the bottom of this page.</p>
```

This technique allows for precise navigation within a document.


**Absolute Vs Relative URLs**

There are two types of URLs: absolute and relative.

**Absolute URL:**
- Points to a location defined by its absolute web location, including the protocol and domain name.
- Always refers to the same location, regardless of where it's used.
- Example: `https://www.example.com/projects/index.html` or `https://www.example.com/projects/`.

**Relative URL:**
- Points to a location relative to the file you are linking from.
- Example: If linking from `https://www.example.com/projects/index.html` to a PDF file in the same directory, the relative link is just the filename, like `project-brief.pdf`. If the PDF is in a subdirectory called `pdfs`, the relative link would be `pdfs/project-brief.pdf`.
- The location it points to depends on the file's actual location; if you move the file, the link destination changes accordingly.
- Be cautious when moving files, as it might lead to broken links if not managed carefully.

**Best Practices for Writing Links:**

1. **Use Clear Link Wording:**
   - Provide descriptive link text that is meaningful out of context.
   - Good: `<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Download Firefox</a>`
   - Bad: `<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Click here</a> to download Firefox`

2. **Avoid Repetitive or Redundant Link Text:**
   - Don't repeat the URL in the link text.
   - Don't include unnecessary phrases like "link" or "links to."

3. **Keep Link Text Short:**
   - Short link text is more manageable for screen readers.

4. **Minimize Duplicating Link Text:**
   - Avoid linking the same text to different destinations, especially when labeled with generic terms like "click here."

5. **Linking to Non-HTML Resources ‚Äî Clear Signposts:**
   - When linking to downloadable, streamed, or content with unexpected effects, provide clear wording.
   - Example: `<a href="https://www.example.com/large-report.pdf">Download the sales report (PDF, 10MB)</a>`

6. **Use the Download Attribute for Downloads:**
   - When linking to downloadable resources, use the download attribute to set a default save filename.
   - Example: `<a href="download-link" download="filename">Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)</a>`

**Simple Navigation page example**

The code -

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>Homepage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- Navigation menu -->

    <ul>
      <li>Home</li>
      <li><a href="pictures.html">Pictures</a></li>
      <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
      <li><a href="social.html">Social</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Homepage</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my exciting homepage</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

üîó **Email Links**

To create links or buttons that open a new outgoing email message, you can use the `<a>` element with the `mailto:` URL scheme. In its basic form, a `mailto:` link indicates the email address of the intended recipient. Here's an example:

```html
<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>
```

This creates a link that, when clicked, opens the user's email client to send an email to the specified address. If you omit the email address and use "mailto:", a new outgoing email window will be opened with no destination address. This can be useful for "Share" links, allowing users to choose their own email recipient.
