## Roadmap

ðŸš€ "HTML Basics: Getting Started"

Learn the fundamental concepts of HTML, including elements, attributes, and page structure. 

ðŸš€ "In the Head: HTML Metadata Simplified"

Explore the unseen part of an HTML documentâ€”its head. Discover crucial metadata, including page title, CSS links for styling, custom favicons, and essential information about the document.

ðŸš€ Understanding HTML Text Semantics

HTML's primary role is to give text meaning, enabling proper display in browsers. Explore breaking up text with headings, paragraphs, adding emphasis, creating lists, and more using HTML.

ðŸš€ Mastering Hyperlinks in HTML

Explore the crucial role of hyperlinks in shaping the web. Learn the syntax for creating links and discover best practices for effective hyperlinking.

ðŸš€ Unveiling Advanced Text Formatting in HTML

Delve into lesser-known HTML elements for text formatting beyond the basics. Explore markup for quotations, description lists, code, subscript, superscript, contact information, and more.

ðŸš€ Crafting Document and Website Structure with HTML

Beyond individual elements, HTML is key to defining the structure of your website. Learn how to plan a basic website structure and write HTML to represent sections like the header, navigation menu, and main content column.

ðŸš€ HTML Debugging Essentials

Writing HTML is one thing, but what if errors arise? Explore tools to troubleshoot and debug HTML code effectively in this informative article.

ðŸŒŽ **Anatomy of a HTML**

```html
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

An element in HTML has three parts:

1. **Opening tag:** It marks the beginning of the element and is enclosed in angle brackets. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph.

2. **Content:** This is the actual text or information within the element. For a paragraph element, it's the text of the paragraph.

3. **Closing tag:** Similar to the opening tag but with a forward slash before the element name. It marks the end of the element. For a paragraph, the closing tag is `</p>`.

So, an HTML element is a combination of the opening tag, content, and closing tag.

ðŸŒŽ **NESTING ELEMENTS**

In HTML, elements can be nested, meaning one element can be placed inside another. For example, if we want to emphasize that our cat is very grumpy, we can use the `<strong>` element to make the word "very" bold within the paragraph:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

ðŸŒŽ **VOID ELEMENTS**

It's important that the opening and closing tags are properly nested, meaning they are inside each other without overlapping.

Some HTML elements don't follow the usual pattern of an opening tag, content, and closing tag. They are called "void elements." An example is the `<img>` element, which is used to embed an image. It consists of a single tag and is used like this:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Firefox icon" />
```

In this example, the `<img>` element embeds an image onto the page, and it doesn't have a closing tag.

ðŸŒŽ **ATTRIBUTES**

In HTML, attributes provide extra information about an element. Here's how to use them with the `<img>` element:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="The Firefox icon" width="300" height="300" />
```

Attributes are added to the element tag and include information such as the image source (`src`), alternative text (`alt`), width (`width`), and height (`height`). Each attribute is separated by spaces and follows the pattern: `attribute="value"`.


ðŸŒŽ **BOOLEAN ATTRIBUTES**

In HTML, some attributes are written without values and are called Boolean attributes. They can only have one value, usually the same as the attribute name. For example, the disabled attribute can be used with form input elements to prevent user entries. It can be written with or without a value:
```html
<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
```
As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:

```html
<!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -->

<input type="text" disabled />

<!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute -->

<input type="text" />

```

ðŸŒŽ **OMITTING QUOTES AROUND ATTRIBUTES VALUES**

The provided HTML code features an anchor element (<a>) creating a hyperlink. Initially, only the href attribute is used:

```html
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>
```

However, issues arise when adding a title attribute without quotes:

```html
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>
```

The absence of quotes causes the browser to misinterpret the title attribute, leading to errors. To correct this, use quotes around attribute values:

```html
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla homepage">favorite website</a>
```

This ensures proper attribute handling and avoids potential problems in the markup.

ðŸŒŽ **SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTES**

You can use either single or double quotes for HTML attribute values based on your preference. Both are equivalent:

```html
<a href='https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>
<a href="https://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a>
```

However, it's crucial not to mix single and double quotes, as shown in the problematic example below:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>
```

Ensure consistency by using either single or double quotes throughout your HTML code.

ðŸ§µ **Anatomy of an HTML Document**

The provided code is a basic HTML document with the following structure:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's a breakdown of each section:

- `<!doctype html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).

- `<html lang="en-US">`: The opening tag for the HTML document, indicating the language as English (United States).

- `<head>`: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as character encoding and the document's title.

- `<meta charset="utf-8" />`: Specifies the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, which is widely used for supporting various characters.

- `<title>My test page</title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document to "My test page."

- `<body>`: The main content of the HTML document goes within this section.

- `<p>This is my page</p>`: A paragraph of text inside the body, stating "This is my page."

- `</html>`: The closing tag for the HTML document.

This example represents a simple HTML document structure with a title and a paragraph of text.


ðŸ§µ **Creation of an Sample HTML Document**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is my First HTML Intro Page</h1>
    <p>You can listen to the music which is <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msokY714Wzg/">composed by me</a></strong>. It is streaming on all platforms.</p>
  </body>
</html>

```
