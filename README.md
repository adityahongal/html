## Documentation

üåé **Anatomy of a HTML**

```html
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

An element in HTML has three parts:

1. **Opening tag:** It marks the beginning of the element and is enclosed in angle brackets. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph.

2. **Content:** This is the actual text or information within the element. For a paragraph element, it's the text of the paragraph.

3. **Closing tag:** Similar to the opening tag but with a forward slash before the element name. It marks the end of the element. For a paragraph, the closing tag is `</p>`.

So, an HTML element is a combination of the opening tag, content, and closing tag.

üåé **NESTING ELEMENTS**

In HTML, elements can be nested, meaning one element can be placed inside another. For example, if we want to emphasize that our cat is very grumpy, we can use the `<strong>` element to make the word "very" bold within the paragraph:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

üåé **VOID ELEMENTS**

It's important that the opening and closing tags are properly nested, meaning they are inside each other without overlapping.

Some HTML elements don't follow the usual pattern of an opening tag, content, and closing tag. They are called "void elements." An example is the `<img>` element, which is used to embed an image. It consists of a single tag and is used like this:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Firefox icon" />
```

In this example, the `<img>` element embeds an image onto the page, and it doesn't have a closing tag.

üåé **ATTRIBUTES**

In HTML, attributes provide extra information about an element. Here's how to use them with the `<img>` element:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="The Firefox icon" width="300" height="300" />
```

Attributes are added to the element tag and include information such as the image source (`src`), alternative text (`alt`), width (`width`), and height (`height`). Each attribute is separated by spaces and follows the pattern: `attribute="value"`.


üåé **BOOLEAN ATTRIBUTES**

In HTML, some attributes are written without values and are called Boolean attributes. They can only have one value, usually the same as the attribute name. For example, the disabled attribute can be used with form input elements to prevent user entries. It can be written with or without a value:
```html
<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
```
As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:

```html
<!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -->

<input type="text" disabled />

<!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute -->

<input type="text" />

```

üåé **OMITTING QUOTES AROUND ATTRIBUTES VALUES**

The provided HTML code features an anchor element (<a>) creating a hyperlink. Initially, only the href attribute is used:

```html
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>
```

However, issues arise when adding a title attribute without quotes:

```html
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>
```

The absence of quotes causes the browser to misinterpret the title attribute, leading to errors. To correct this, use quotes around attribute values:

```html
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla homepage">favorite website</a>
```

This ensures proper attribute handling and avoids potential problems in the markup.

üåé **SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTES**

You can use either single or double quotes for HTML attribute values based on your preference. Both are equivalent:

```html
<a href='https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>
<a href="https://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a>
```

However, it's crucial not to mix single and double quotes, as shown in the problematic example below:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>
```

Ensure consistency by using either single or double quotes throughout your HTML code.

üßµ **Anatomy of an HTML Document**

The provided code is a basic HTML document with the following structure:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's a breakdown of each section:

- `<!doctype html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).

- `<html lang="en-US">`: The opening tag for the HTML document, indicating the language as English (United States).

- `<head>`: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as character encoding and the document's title.

- `<meta charset="utf-8" />`: Specifies the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, which is widely used for supporting various characters.

- `<title>My test page</title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document to "My test page."

- `<body>`: The main content of the HTML document goes within this section.

- `<p>This is my page</p>`: A paragraph of text inside the body, stating "This is my page."

- `</html>`: The closing tag for the HTML document.

This example represents a simple HTML document structure with a title and a paragraph of text.


üßµ **Creation of an Sample HTML Document**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is my First HTML Intro Page</h1>
    <p>You can listen to the music which is <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msokY714Wzg/">composed by me</a></strong>. It is streaming on all platforms.</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

üßµ **Entity references: Including special characters in HTML**

In HTML, certain characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `&` have special meanings in the syntax. To include them as regular text, use character references. These references start with `&` and end with `;`:

- `<` is represented as `&lt;`
- `>` is represented as `&gt;`
- `"` is represented as `&quot;`
- `'` is represented as `&apos;`
- `&` is represented as `&amp;`

The character reference equivalent could be easily remembered because the text it uses can be seen as less than for &lt;, quotation for &quot; and similarly for others.

In the example below, there are two paragraphs:
```html
<p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the <p> element.</p>

<p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
```
In the output below, you can see that the first paragraph has gone wrong. The browser interprets the second instance of <p> as starting a new paragraph. The second paragraph looks fine because it has angle brackets with character references.

```html
In HTML, you define a paragraph using the

element.

In HTML, you define a paragraph using the <p> element.
```

üßµ **HTML comments**

In HTML, comments are a way to include notes in the code for explanation or documentation purposes. Browsers ignore comments, making them invisible to users. Comments are useful for explaining logic, especially when revisiting code after some time, and they serve as valuable documentation when multiple people are working on the codebase.

To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <!-- and -->. For example:

```html
<p>I'm not inside a comment</p>

<!-- <p>I am!</p> -->

```


## What's in the head? Metadata in HTML

‚òùÔ∏è **What is HTML Head ?**

The HTML head is the contents of the <head> element. Unlike the contents of the <body> element (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document.
```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>My test page</title>
</head>
```

‚òùÔ∏è **Adding a title**

We've already seen the <title> element in action ‚Äî this can be used to add a title to the document. This however can get confused with the h1 element, which is used to add a top level heading to your body content ‚Äî this is also sometimes referred to as the page title. But they are different things!

1. **`<h1>`** Element:
   - Appears on the loaded page in the browser.
   - Should be used once per page to mark up the main title of your content, such as a story title or news headline.

2. **`<title>`** Element:
   - Represents metadata for the overall HTML document.
   - Reflects the title of the entire HTML document, not the content within the document.

Example code and screenshot:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>&lt;title&gt; element</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>&lt;h1&gt; element</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

‚òù **Metadata: the <meta> element**

Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document ‚Äî the ```<meta>``` element.

Specifying your document's character encoding

```html 
<meta charset="utf-8" /> 
```
In the above example,this element specifies the document's character encoding ‚Äî the character set that the document is permitted to use. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes pretty much any character from any human language. This means that your web page will be able to handle displaying any language; it's therefore a good idea to set this on every web page you create!

‚òù **Applying CSS and Javascript to HTML**

To enhance the appearance and functionality of websites, CSS and JavaScript are commonly used. In HTML, you employ the `<link>` element for CSS and the `<script>` element for JavaScript.

For CSS:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="my-css-file.css" />
```

This goes inside the `<head>` of your document.

For JavaScript:

```html
<script src="my-js-file.js" defer></script>
```

Also placed in the `<head>`, the `defer` attribute ensures that the JavaScript is loaded after the HTML is parsed, preventing potential errors.
